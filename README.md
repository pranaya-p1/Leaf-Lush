# Project Definition – Leaf & Lush

## Purpose
Leaf & Lush is a gardening-themed social networking web application designed to make gardening easy and accessible for young people. It allows users to share tips, post videos, participate in contests, buy and sell garden-related items, and track plant growth using personal dashboards. Our goal is to create a supportive online gardening community.

## Functional Requirements (What the app will do)
- Users can create an account and log in
- Users can create dashboards for their plants
- Users can post gardening tips, images, and videos
- Users can read newsletters on gardening topics
- Users can enter gardening contests
- Users can buy/sell garden-related goods through the platform
- Users can complete “quests” (gamified gardening challenges)
- Users can flag/report misinformation
- Admins can approve expert-verified posts

## Non-Functional Requirements (How the app will look & perform)
- Clean and modern UI with earthy colour tones (greens, browns)
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design
- Fast loading (under 3 seconds per page)
- Safe and secure login with multi-factor authentication
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- Regular data backups and use of firewalls
- IDS/IPS monitoring for suspicious activity

## Project Scope
The core features like posting, dashboards, and contests are achievable within 10 weeks. We will start with basic versions of each feature and develop them further if time allows.

## Scope Issues
Some advanced features such as:
- Buying and selling with payment integration
- Full encryption and security features
- Complex admin/moderation tools  
...may not be completed in full due to the time constraint, but we will include basic mockups or simplified versions.
